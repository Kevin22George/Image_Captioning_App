# Image Captioning App

## Description
An image captioning app built with trained images and captions that predicts captions based on the context of the image. The aim here is to attain the best caption prediction accuracy on the images. To create the most efficient Caption Embedder feature for users that can fulfil all their needs when embedding a caption onto an image. I plan on implementing my project to users that can benefit from it such as people with visual impairments which brings efficiency when it comes to identifying images. To allow users embed a caption onto an image with customizable tools available to experiment on and post it on their socials or for any other personal/business use.
